          text="We introduce therapeutics ML tasks, datasets, and benchmarks spanning an unprecedented number of modalities.
          Modalities in TDC-2 include but are not limited to: single-cell gene expression atlases,
single-cell chemical and genetic perturbations, clinical trial outcome data, peptide sequence data,
peptidomimetics protein-peptide interaction data from AS-MS spectroscopy, novel 3D
structural protein data, and cell-type-specific protein-protein interaction networks
at single-cell resolution. TDC-2 introduces ML tasks taking on open challenges, including the
inferential gap in precision medicine and evaluation on longitudinal data,
model generalization across cell lines and single-cell perturbations that were not encountered during 
model training, and evaluation of models across a broad range of diverse biological
contexts."
